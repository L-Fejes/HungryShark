As an overall summary I approached this game deciding it would be best served as a top down view game.  
I decided that for expediency I'd use an asset to handle to the fish movement, and designed the game with simple collision detection 
as the goal for determining the points.  I ran into a simple issue in that I'd renamed a script around half way through the development
process, and sadly didn't catch that till the end, which compeltely reverted my player script, unfortunatley this only became apparent
as I was working on a copy of it and not the proper script, so I quickly attempted to rewrite the basic functions I'd implemented.

To improve this experience I'd start by including a start screen, and end screen.  I would then implement a follow camera, so instead of limiting
the player movement field, the player would have a much wider area to explore, then I would reimpliment the boost mechanics I'd initially had, to
allow the player to make short rapid dashes, allowing for more exciting gameplay.  I'd then also include differnet movement behaviours on the fish
so some would intentially avoid the player, some would flock around each other, and some would hide.  Which would then require some environment objects.
